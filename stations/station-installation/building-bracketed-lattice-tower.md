## Steps

### Choosing a location

The most important thing in choosing where to locate a tower on a building is to choose the location with the least obstructed view for the antennas. For example, the 9-element Yagi Antennas can reach about a 20 KM range, assuming that there is nothing obstructing their view within that distance. First step is to choose which direction you want your directional (Yagi) antennas to point. Then choose a location on the building where that direction can be easily accessed by the antenna. This usually means attaching near the highest point on the building so that the building it is attached to does not get in the way, but this is not necessary if the antennas all point away from the building. Other things to consider include:

* Relatively flat ground where the base plate needs to sit.
* Away from power lines, in case the equipment falls during installation.
* Where there is a bit of roof overhang (best for attaching brackets).
* Near an A/C outlet, otherwise you are running a long extension cable.
* Within range of Wi-Fi if you plan to connect. Otherwise you might want to use a Wi-Fi extender. This means you won’t have to download data manually.

### Tower sections

1. If you need more than one 10 ft tower section, bolt multiple sections together by inserting the smaller end into the larger end.
2. Bolt pieces together using bolts provided (taped to tower sections). The bolts should be pointing inward to avoid scraping ankles on the ends when climbing.

### Top kit

1. The end of the tower section with a smaller tube diameter is the top, where the top kit gets attached.
2. Open up the top kit box and baggies. It comes with [instructions for two models](https://wadeantenna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/390354_C01_GN_N1311.pdf) (see below) – ours is the 244A so don’t worry about the diagrams with the U-bolts. There is also [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjGHGMamWQQ) showing how to do this part so it may be helpful to have that on hand when in the field.

### House brackets

1. Get a measurement from the ground to where the house brackets will attach to the building (underneath roof overhang).
2. Attach house brackets in approximately the right position on the lattice tower. Secure brackets to tower using ubolts and plates. See [video instructions ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VFslyEHGAw)at timestamps 0:00 to 4:15.

### Mast

1. Slide the mast into the top kit so the bottom is about 1 inch below the lower clamp of the top kit. Tighten the bolts on the top mast clamp so the mast stays in place when raising the tower. Remember to later tighten all the bolts on both mast clamps so the mast is fixed firmly in place AFTER attaching antennas.

### Base plate&#x20;

1. Temporarily raise tower to visualize where the base plate should be once the tower is properly located. You want the tower sections to be close to the building, but at least a couple inches away so it doesn’t rub against the building.

#### Soft ground

If installing over soft ground (e.g., soil, small rocks), follow the written instructions below and/or in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VFslyEHGAw) (timestamps 4:15 to 5:15).&#x20;

2. Place the drive stakes in the three holes of the base plate at 45 degree angles, each facing 3 different directions so that the base plate cannot lift up.
3. Using a mallet, hammer roughly 4/5 of the length of the drive stakes into the ground.

#### Hard ground

If installing over hard ground (e.g., cement, large rock), follow these instructions:&#x20;

2. Place the base plate on the ground and use a metal tool or grease marker to mark the center of each hole in the base plate.
3. Wearing safety goggles and an N-95 mask, use the rotary hammer to drill each hole about 3 inches deep. You should hold both handles while drilling – if you only hold the trigger it can break your wrist! Use the clear plastic tubing to blow the rock dust out of the hole periodically. You will likely need to replace the battery between holes.

4. Place a wedge anchor in each hole with the threads facing up and use the mallet to drive the anchor into the hole as far as it will go.
5. Put the base plate over the wedge anchors and then add the washers then nuts to each wedge anchor. Use the channel locks to tighten the nuts as much as possible.

### Raising the tower

1. Use the channel locks to squeeze the attachment points on the base plate so they are a little closer together.
2. Open the package of nuts and bolts that was attached to the base plate.
3. Carefully raise the tower and place on each of the attachment points.
4. With 2 people holding the tower up, a third person can start inserting the bolts into the attachment points. Bolts should be pointing inward to avoid scraping ankles on the ends. The feet of the tower will be raised a bit – this is normal. After putting a bolt in, add a lock washer and a nut on the other end. You only need it finger tight until all bolts are inserted.
5. Use the magnetic level to make sure the tower is level. The people holding the tower should continuously ensure the tower is level as you attach the house brackets.
6. Attach 2x4 wood to underside of roof using lag bolts and impact driver.
7. Attach house brackets to 2x4 wood using lag bolts and impact driver.
8. Tighten U-Bolt attachment points on tower. Remember, you attached the housing brackets to the tower before raising the tower (see above), which makes this much easier than doing it when the tower is raised.

See additional [video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VFslyEHGAw) at timestamps 5:15 and onward.

### Antennas

1.  Assemble the Yagi antennas using the provided instructions. Some helpful tips:

    a.      The hose clamps should be placed at the edge of the tube to maximize the clamping power.

    b.      Tighten the hose clamps using a 5/16 hex bit – it’s so much easier!

    c.      Attach the coax cable and seal it using the provided coax-seal before zip-tying.

    d.      Attach the mounting bracket such that the plate sits vertically while the antenna elements are horizontal and fix in place so that it won’t move around on its own, but can be adjusted with a little force.
2. Assemble the omni antenna mounting brackets. Keep it loose so it can still easily slide on to the omni.
3. &#x20;Colour- and number-code each antenna and the coax cable (end nearest ground) it is attached to with electrical tape. &#x20;
4. From the roof, slide the two Yagi antennas onto the mast
5. Slide on the two omni mounting brackets and then slide the omni on to the bracket. Tighten the bolts on the bracket until the omni is fixed firmly in place.
6. Lower the mast as needed to reach the top by untightening and retightening the bolts in the top mast clamp.&#x20;
7. Once all antennas are in position and the mast is raised, tighten all the bolts on both mast clamps so the mast is fixed firmly in place.
8. Attach the designated coax cable to the omni and zip tie it to the mast below it.
9. Use a compass to get the bearings for the two directions you’d like to point your Yagis.&#x20;
10. Slide up the middle antenna until it’s directly below the omni, point it in the right direction, and fix it firmly in place.
11. Move the bottom antenna until it is about 2 feet below the middle antenna and then rotate it until it is pointing in the correct direction. Tighten the larger U bolts to fix the antenna firmly in place.
12. Rotate the angle of the antenna elements to ensure both Yagi antennas will be properly horizontal (i.e., elements are perpendicular to the mast).
13. Tighten the smaller U bolts to fix them firmly in place.
14. Zip tie the coax cable to the mast all the way down the tower and then use the wire clips to clip off the ends of the zip ties.
15. Attach the coax cables to the receiver in the following order:

    a.      Top antenna on the first connector

    b.      Middle antenna on the second

    c.      Bottom antenna on the third

### Climb shields

1. Place climb shields at a height on the tower that will prevent anyone from being able to climb the stairs.
2. Use impact driver and self-tapping screws with 5/16 hex bit to attach climb shield to lattice tower.
3. Attach a Motus sign on climb shields using self-tapping screws.

### Receiver

1.  Attach receiver case to a) tower, or b) inside building for further waterproofing.

    a.      If attaching a **Sensorgnome** to tower, drill holes in outside ridges of Pelican case and use zip ties to attach to tower. Make sure you attach in a way that the box can still be opened for maintenance. If attaching a **SensorStation** to tower, use bracket provided to attach case to tower.

    b.      If attaching receiver inside, drill a hole in the building with a 1 ½” hole saw: Use the stud finder to check for wires in the wall before drilling. Run the cables through the hole, and connect the coax cables to the receiver as explained in step 11 of “Antennas” section. Secure the receiver case somewhere convenient and where it will not be disturbed/unplugged. Fill the hole in the wall with sealant. &#x20;
2. If the receiver is outdoors and you want to plug the extension cord into the wall indoors (for waterproofing or easier access to an outlet), use the ½” hole saw to drill a hole into the building. Use the stud finder to check for wires in the wall before drilling. The end of the extension cord will need to be cut in order to fit into the hole and reattached to an electrical plug (male-end) once inside the building.
3. Follow instructions for [Sensorgnome V1](https://docs.motus.org/sensorgnome), [Sensorgnome V2](https://docs.motus.org/sensorgnome-v2), or [CTT SensorStation](https://cellular-tracking-technologies.github.io/ctt_documentation/SensorStation-User-Guide.html) to power receiver and connect to available network.&#x20;
