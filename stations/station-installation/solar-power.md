#### Instructions

See [solar charge controller wiring](https://github.com/leberrigan/MotusDocs/blob/main/stations/appendix-c.md#charge-controller-wiring) for a diagram.

1. Prepare your cables by crimping **14 AWG spade connectors** to the ends of all your cables.
   * For the battery, prepare one \*\*\*\* fused battery lead \_\_ and one length of the 14 AWG stranded automotive/speaker wire.
2. Carefully inspect the charge controllers and note the positive and negative terminals for: the Solar Panel (input); the battery; the load (output).
3. Ensure the power rating on the back of the solar panel does not exceed the ratings of the charge controller.
4. Loosen the positive and negative terminals of the battery and attach the battery cable one at a time, using a **fused battery lead** for the _positive terminal_ and **14 AWG stranded automotive/speaker wire** to the _negative terminal_.
5. Loosen the _positive and negative terminals for the battery_ on the **solar charge controller** and attached the battery cables, beginning with the positive side.
6. Proceed to connect the solar panel cables to the solar charge controller, again beginning with the positive side.
7. Finally, connect the load (receiver) to the load terminals of the solar charge controller, positive first.

**Motus Pro Tip**

Sometimes the charge controller may indicate the battery level is low, or will cycle through different levels when first connected. This is normal as it is calculating the average voltage over time to gain an accurate measurement.
